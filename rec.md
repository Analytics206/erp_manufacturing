Summary
Hey there! Thanks for reviewing our job offer. Crucial information related to this job (including all of the information below) is in the attached PDF. Please give that a look.

We are seeking one proficient developer to construct a bespoke enterprise resource planning (ERP) SaaS. The team is currently comprised of developers in managerial roles: a product owner/project manager (me), and a fractional operator. The developer we hire will be the only person on the project whose sole role is coding.

This ERP system follows an estimate-job-invoice workflow. This job is staged in seven phases, and will have seven milestones. A metalworking company needs this ERP to handle their client estimate generation/submission, job management, inventory, and client invoice generation/submission.

You can review a demo (UI only, no logic) of the ERP at https://valor.appsandsides.com/. This demo does not yet totally represent the desired final product. The repo of this demo will be available to you.

This job has the opportunity for further work on the same ERP, and other projects that are similar.

The details of this job for the developer (you) are as follows:

- This job can follow an semi-Agile workflow, unless the developer we hire wishes to modify that.
    - We expect to show and test updates with our client and communicate vision back to the developer throughout the development process.
- Work can be completed as asynchronously as the developer wishes.
    - I’m always available to answer questions, bounce ideas, and be a partner/reviewer. This can be as collaborative of a process as the developer wishes.
    - The developer comes first: what they need to get the job done, they will have.
- The developer will have a large say about the tech stack. We want to work with what you want in order for this job to go smoothly.
    - The developer should include their tech stack recommendation in their proposal. If they are framework-agnostic, they should include their past experience.
- This project has been pitched on a 18-month timeline, starting from the developer hire date.
    - Each phase has a “pitched” timeline, which can be negotiated with the developer.
- The developer is highly encouraged to use AI tools, especially in user interface design. Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking has built some beautiful interfaces in Tailwind for us, and we expect that level of beautiful design in interfaces we ship.
    - Zed, Cursor, and/or GitHub Copilot are encouraged.
    - Experience with using AI to build UI will boost a developer’s proposal.
    - Experience with using Zed, Cursor, or Copilot in VS Code will also boost a developer’s proposal.
    - Using AI to write logic is entirely acceptable, but the developer must be capable of debugging and modifying the logic which AI writes.
    - We suggest Claude Sonnet 4 Thinking.
- The ability to read, write, speak, and listen to English is required. English communication skills must be proficient enough to be able to understand and relay back information.
- Prior experience on Upwork is not as important as a developer’s portfolio. Reviews will certainly be considered.
- We certainly accept proposals written with AI. However, please include in your proposal a short, personal note that you wrote yourself. (We wrote this whole list ourselves!)
- Our price is not firm – please feel free to come in above or below at any margin you wish. We will consider all proposals.

# Process

We use **Basecamp** for project management, and a **GitHub org** for git hosting. A sprint could look like this (and can look differently depending on what the developer needs):

1. Managers (me & operator) develop a kanban board of user stories for the current sprint.
2. Developer assigns user story tickets to themself. Developer has total access to developers to ask questions, receive clarification, troubleshoot, and/or brainstorm. Developer also can contest a ticket if they believe its out of alignment or not correct.
3. Developer creates a pull request on the repo for each ticket. CI on GitHub.
4. Managers do a quick code review and communicate back any concerns.
5. CD to Vercel on merge.
6. A quick asynchronous sync over text at the end of each sprint to make sure expectations on both sides are being met. If our client has any concerns, we will manage and/or relay those concerns.
7. Rinse and repeat!

# Environment

The developer has a wide berth in this job to use the tech stack that suits them best to get the job done. The developer should include the tech stack they wish to use in their proposal. This is an example tech stack that’s familiar to us.

- Vercel (dev enviro)
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- JS and/or TS
- Firebase
- Firestore
- Cloud Functions
- Firebase Storage
- Cloud Messaging
- Firebase Auth
- SES

We would love to use Postgres across the entire app just to make the statistics & reporting dashboard easier to code and maintain at scale. That being said, the client might find the cost of running serverless Postgres exorbitant on the upfront.

If you are interested in developing this project in a different tech stack, include data in your proposal that shows your recommendation beats Firebase’s cost structure at the scale of small-business usage (2 managers, ~10 workers who only clock in and out of jobs).
