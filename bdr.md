# 1. 📌 Executive Summary

The purpose of the Valor ERP project is to develop a custom ERP SaaS platform tailored for a metalworking company. The system will manage customer estimates, job tracking, inventory control, time & attendance, invoicing, and reporting. It will streamline business operations, enable remote and asynchronous work, and prioritize beautiful, modern UI/UX with a developer-empowered, AI-augmented build process.

# 2. 🎯 Objectives
- Enable efficient estimate-to-invoice workflows.
- Support job tracking and inventory synchronization.
- Simplify timekeeping and payroll preparation.
- Offer clear, actionable reporting dashboards.
- Provide a scalable, modular, and maintainable system.
